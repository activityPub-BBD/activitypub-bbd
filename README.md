# Chirp üê¶

**Chirp** is a federated social media app inspired by Mastodon and powered by [Fedify](https://github.com/modern-activitypub/fedify). It allows users to create local accounts, publish posts, and follow remote ActivityPub actors. Chirp integrates **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) for core user and content data, and **Neo4j** to efficiently manage and query social graph relationships like followers and mutuals.

## üìö Features

- Federated post sharing and retrieval using ActivityPub
- Follows and unfollows tracked via **Neo4j**
- Local user authentication (e.g. Google login)
- Media posting with support for images and video
- Mutual/follower suggestions via graph traversal
- Fedify-based ActivityPub protocol implementation
